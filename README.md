### 👋 I'm Ian Hunter, I make stuff on the internet. 

#### はじめまして!

I've been a developer for over 30 years, recently I've been expanding my learning into marketing, design, and growth. More about me here: [ianhunter.org](https://ianhunter.org)

I'm the Founder of [@ctostudio](https://cto.studio) - CTO services, on demand. We pair veteran CTOs with companies looking for advice or insight into their technical organizations. 

> Note: If you're a senior, veteran technologist, consider moonlighting with us for $500/hour!
